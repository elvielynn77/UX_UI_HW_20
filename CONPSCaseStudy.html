                    <h3>Colorado Native Plant Society</h3>
                    <img src="Images/CONPSheader.png">
                    <p>We conducted a hypothetical redesign of the non-profit organization Colorado Native Plant Society (CONPS). This organization is dedicated to furthering the knowledge, appreciation and conservation of native plants and habitats of Colorado through education, stewardship and advocacy.</p>

                    <h3>User Research</h3>
                    <p>Through conducting a google survey and 5 one on one interviews, we learned that users were not previously aware of CONPS, and that the current website does not effectively communicate the organizations mission and achievements.</p>

                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <h4>Problem Statement:</h4>
                    <p>User Scenario: Azalea Potts, a young botany student, is looking for an organization to get involved with that is actively benefiting local conservation efforts because they are passionate about conserving nature and want to make a difference that they can see.</p>
                    <p2>How might we redesign Conps.org to highlight their work, mission and goals to ultimately increase their visibility as an organization? We observed during user interviews that CONPS overall mission and achievements were unclear based off initial website use.</p2>
                    <p3>Problem Statement: The Colorado Native Plant Society website does not effectively portray their mission and achievements as a non-profit organization, leading to confusion in users and lack of visibility for the organization.</p3>
                    <h5>The Solution</h5>
                    <p>We believe that a redesign of CONPS.org information architecture, navigation, and homepage will improve clarity and usability, better highlight their mission and achievements, and overall increase visibility for The Colorado Native Plant Society leading to more members and higher event attendance.</p>
